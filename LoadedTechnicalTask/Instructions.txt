We've created a basic .Net 5 project using an in-memory database. The data in the database is reset each time the application is run. 
There are two entities - Staff Members and Timesheets. Each staff member can have zero or many timesheets. 
There is also one example controller and endpoint.

The task is to create an API that allows:
* Getting a list of staff members.
* Recording clock ins for individual staff members.
* Recording clock outs for individual staff members.

Create/implement any classes, interfaces, folders etc that you need for this.

Use Git to commit your work as often as makes sense. 
Try not to spend more than 1-2 hours total on the task (of course if you've got questions and it takes me a while to get back to you then that's OK. We just don't want you to spend your entire day on this).

Please contact Gus with any questions - I'm available on 021 139 3994 and I should be free all weekend.

Notes:
* The example endpoint uses HTTP (not HTTPS), and this is fine for the rest of the API as well.
* Don't worry about implementing any authentication or authorization layers.
* The data is reset on each run of the application, and the unique IDs of the seed data are randomised. 
  The task is about how the API is designed and implemented, so don't worry about making data persistant between each run.
